Friend, either you're closing your eyes to a situation you do not wish to acknowledge
Or you are not aware of the caliber of disaster
Indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community!
Well, ya got trouble my friend
Right here, I say, trouble right here in River City
Why sure, I'm a billiard player, certainly
Mighty proud I say, I'm always mighty proud to say it
I consider that the hours I spend with a cue in my hand are golden
Helps you cultivate horse sense and a cool head and a keen eye
Did you ever take and try to find an iron-clad leave for yourself from a three-rail billiard shot?
But just as I say it takes judgement, brains and maturity to score in a balkline game
I say that any boob can take and shove a ball in a pocket
And I call that sloth. The first big step on the road to the depths of degrada-
I say, first, medicinal wine from a teaspoon, then beer from a bottle!
And the next thing you know your son is playing for money in a pinch-back suit
And listening to some big out of town jasper
Hearing him tell about horse race gambling
Not a wholesome trotting race, no
But a race where they set down right on the horse!
Like to see some stuck-up jockey boy setting on Dan Patch?
Make your blood boil? Well, I should say
Now, friends, let me tell you what I mean
You've got one, two, three, four, five, six pockets in a table
Pockets that mark the difference between a gentleman and a bum
With a capital B and that rhymes with P and that stands for Pool!
